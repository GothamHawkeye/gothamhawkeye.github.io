            <h3>Welcome to My Webpage</h3>
            <p>I'm Scott Isebrand. I was born and raised in Iowa, lived briefly in Connecticut, and moved to New York
                City
                in
                1997 to work in marketing in educational publishing. From 2001, I worked for a special events facility
                in
                Manhattan,
                initially in marketing, then in administration.
            <h4>My Path to Boot Camp</h4>
            <h5>The Pandemic & a Civil War General</h5>
            <p>During the first months of the COVID pandemic, I watched the documentary <a
                    href="https://www.history.com/shows/grant" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>Grant</i></a>, about Ulysses S. Grant, the
                victorious commanding-general of the U.S.
                Army during the American Civil
                War and
                twice-elected 18th president of the United States. Afterwards I thought
                that he should be better
                known. At
                the same time, I had become interested in social media and digital marketing, and wondered about
                changing to
                a
                tech-focused career. I decided that a web project about
                U.S. Grant would be interesting for me, and well timed because 2022 would be the bicentennial of Grant's
                birth.
            </p>

            <h5>WordPress Project</h5>

            <p>I knew nothing about coding. So I used to the open-source
                website-builder
                <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress</a> and a
                customizeable WordPress theme
                called <a href="https://codex-themes.com/thegem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TheGem</a>
                to launch my site <a href="https://grantrevealed.com/">Ulysses S.
                    Grant Revealed</a>, (<a href="https://grantrevealed.com/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">GrantRevealed.com</a>).

            <p>I
                enjoyed creating content for the website, embedding images and video in blog posts, and playing around
                with
                formatting through the WordPress. But I often had to open a ticket with the TheGem's
                tech
                support team when parts of the website didn't work as I expected. Their solution
                would
                almost always be to adjust or add CSS code. From those experiences, I began to
                appreciate
                the
                power of understanding Web development.

            <h5>Figuring Out the Magic</h4>

                <p>For most people, the ubiquitous digital reality we all intereact with daily is "magic on a
                    screen," as a friend said, and the code behind it like unimaginably inscrutable spells. But
                    knowledge is
                    power, and
                    I hope to learn coding at Per Scholas&mdash;figuring out mysteries of both frontend and backend
                    development&mdash;to forge a new
                    career as a software developer...a modern-day magician of sorts!
                </p>

        <aside id="trailer-section">
            <h4 id="trailer-head"><i>Grant</i></h4>
            <p id="trailer-text">Though I'd already become interested in social media and had picked up some website
                design
                and digital
                marketing concepts at work, a further step on my road to Per Scholas's Software Engineering boot camp
                was&mdash;surprisingly&mdash;watching a
                three-part documentary on <a href="https://www.history.com/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer">History</a> about a somewhat forgotten 19th-century American general and
                president. It inspired me to
                create
                a website about him.</p>
