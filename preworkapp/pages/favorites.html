            <h3>What's Your Signature Strength?</h3>

            <h4>Shawn Achor's <i>The Happiness Advantage</i></h4>
            <div>
                <p>I stumbled upon an entertaining TEDx Talk some years ago by Shawn Achor, in which he argues that
                    happier
                    employees are more productive. It led me to his book <i>The
                        Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and
                        Performance
                        at
                        Work</i>, in which he encourages readers to find their top ignature strengths and use one daily.
                    He
                    wrote:
                </p>
                <blockquote>When 577 volunteers were encouraged to pick one of their signature strengths and use it in a
                    new
                    way
                    each day for a week, they became significantly happier and less depressed than control groups. And
                    these
                    benefits lasted: Even after the experiment was over, their levels of happiness remained heightened a
                    full
                    six months later. Studies have shown that the more you use your signature strengths in daily life,
                    the
                    happier you become. Find out your own signature strengths, then try to incorporate at least one of
                    them
                    into
                    your life each day. (<cite><a

            <h4>My Top Three Signature Strengths</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Forgiveness.</b> "Forgiving those who have done wrong; accepting others' shortcomings; giving
                    people
                    a
                    second chance; not being vengeful."</li>
                <li><b>Love of Learning.</b> "Mastering new skills, topics, and bodies of knowledge, whether on one's
                    own or
                    formally; related to the strength of curiosity but goes beyond it to describe the tendency to add
                    systematically to what one knows."</li>
                <li><b>Fairness.</b> "Treating all people the same according to notions of fairness and justice; not
                    letting
                    feelings bias decisions about others; giving everyone a fair chance."</li>
